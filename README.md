# Clang-ast-viewer
##Introduction
This program allows you to visualize an AST as it is generated by Clang when analyzing some source code.

Clang does a pretty decent work of displaying a static AST in text mode, but the goal of this program is to make it easier to navigate this AST. Currently, it provides two major benefits:

* When you move the cursor in the source code, the corresponding AST node is highlighted
* When you select a node in the AST, the corresponding source code is selected, allowing you to better understand the purpose of this node.

##Future work
This product is really in its early development stages. Future direction could include:

* Automatically generating some PCH file to improve parsing time 
* Dynamic update of the AST (instead of clicking refresh) 
* Filterinf the AST to remove nodes that come from #included files.
* Add more information to the nodes (value, type information, resolved symbol for functions...), possibly as a property grid.

Feel free to help us with the implementation of those, of of other ideas.
